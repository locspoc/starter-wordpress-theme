# Starter WordPress Theme

## NPM

```
npm i to install

npm run start to start dev

npm run preview
start the watch task and start a proxy server running on localhost:3000 that will automatically refresh the browser anytime you save a change. In order for this feature to work you will need to change the domain in package.json on line #8. In my file it mentions myexample.local but obviously you will have a different local dev domain that you want to proxy.
